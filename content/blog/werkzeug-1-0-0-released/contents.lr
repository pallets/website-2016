The Pallets team is pleased to release Werkzeug 1.0. Werkzeug is the
low-level WSGI and HTTP toolkit that powers Flask. It's been almost 13
years since the first commit, and this milestone for the project brings
many fixes and changes. [Read the full changelog](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/changes/#version-1-0-0)
to understand what may affect your code when upgrading.

-   Drop support for Python 3.4. This will be the last version to
    support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
-   Remove most top-level attributes provided by the `werkzeug` module
    in favor of direct imports. If you haven't already, use
    [version 0.16](/blog/werkzeug-0-16-0-released) first to see
    deprecation warnings while upgrading.
-   Cookies support the ``samesite='None'`` option. Cookies are parsed
    as a `MultiDict` instead of overwriting repeated keys.
-   The development server supports 2-way TLS, making it easier to
    develop applications that inspect client certificates.
-   When building URLs with host matching, the current host is accounted
    for when deciding what rule to build.
-   When defining and matching URL rules, consecutive slashes are merged
    by default to match the behavior of common HTTP servers.
-   The `Accept` header preserves order for tags with equal quality and
    considers options on each value. The  `Accept-Language` header can
    match the primary tag if the specific value is not present.
-   Added CORS header attributes to `Request` and `Response`.
-   A URL rule can be marked as a `websocket`, in which case it will
    only match for `wss://` requests. This allows async web frameworks
    to use Werkzeug for routing.


## Version 2.0 Coming Soon

As outlined in [Ending Python 2 Support](/blog/ending-python2-support),
1.0.x will be the last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5. The next
version will be 2.0 and will support Python 3.6 and newer.
